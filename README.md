### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student in a Data Science Master's Program and this is my first GitHub page, though not my first exposure to GitHub.  I am currently working on my Capstone project, which is similar to a Thesis, though mine is not quite to the level of depth and length that would normally be expected for a Master's thesis.  I plan on expanding upon this project steadily so that I can achieve the level of insight that I hope will lead to a significant change in how my chosen organization operates.  

I am hoping to develop my skills in Data Science, specifically in the use of R, Python, and SAS.  I particularly enjoy R and am hoping its use will open up new opportunities in my current position and, as my skills increase, may open different opportunities in other organizations.  I anyone has any suggestions on how to improve my skills, and tutorials, or interesting data sets that I can work on please feel free to send them to me.

Fun fact: I love roman and medieval history!
